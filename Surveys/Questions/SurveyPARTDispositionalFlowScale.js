We are so concentrated that time may seem to expand or pass too quickly, and we feel strongly motivated to continue that activity to remain in this psychological state. It is an intense and positive psychological state, as what we imagine an experienced climber may feel while facing the challenge of a new rock wall, or the artist taken from the composition of the last work he has created. Think of a situation of limited duration (from a few minutes to a few hours) in which he felt such a sensation: the following questions are about the thoughts and feelings he felt in that situation. There are no right or wrong answers. Mark with a cross how much you experienced each characteristic during the activity you have considered, using the scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always) (Never/Rarely/Sometimes/Frequently/Always):
